# Late Bot

This bot was made (actually still making) to keep track on missing or late students. To keep everything in one place.

## Tech:
General:
- Python 3.10
- Docker
- Docker-compose
- CI (in future, for deploing, notification and testing the whole project)

Bot:
- python-telegram-bot 13.7

Db module:
- Django 4.10 (with default db config, cause we have just 15 entities in database)
- DRF
- Celery + Redis (for scheduled tasks) (new expirience)

# Make it work

```Coming soon```

Authors:
- Demianight - Database, Celery and network stuff
